# Concepts

Sentinel operates on a few core abstractions. Understanding these helps you reason about what the library does and why.

## Metadata

Metadata is a normalized representation of a struct type. Where Go's `reflect` package gives you low-level access to type information, metadata gives you a structured view: the type's identity, its fields, and its relationships to other types.

Sentinel extracts metadata at two levels. [Type metadata](../4.reference/2.types.md#metadata) captures the struct as a whole—its name, package, and the graph of types it references. [Field metadata](../4.reference/2.types.md#fieldmetadata) captures each exported field—its name, type, kind, and struct tags.

Only exported fields are visible. Go's reflection cannot access unexported fields from outside their package, so sentinel doesn't try.

## Type Identity

Every type has a fully qualified domain name (FQDN): the package path combined with the type name. For example, `github.com/you/app/models.User`.

FQDNs matter because type names alone aren't unique. Two packages can define a `User` type. The FQDN distinguishes them, and sentinel uses it as the cache key and in relationship references.

## Relationships

Struct fields that reference other structs create [relationships](../4.reference/2.types.md#typerelationship). Sentinel categorizes these into [four kinds](../4.reference/2.types.md#relationship-kinds):

- **Reference** — a direct struct or pointer field (`Profile *Profile`)
- **Collection** — a slice or array of structs (`Orders []Order`)
- **Embedding** — an anonymous field (`BaseModel`)
- **Map** — a map with struct values (`Items map[string]Item`)

Relationships are directional: they point from the containing type to the referenced type. Together, a set of relationships forms a type graph that you can traverse.

## Field Kinds

Each field has a [kind](../4.reference/2.types.md#fieldkind) that categorizes its type for conditional logic: `scalar`, `pointer`, `slice`, `struct`, `map`, or `interface`. This lets you branch on the shape of a field without parsing type strings.

## Immutability

Go's type system is fixed at compile time. A struct's fields, types, and tags cannot change while the program runs. Sentinel exploits this: once metadata is extracted, it never needs to be re-extracted or invalidated. The cache is permanent.

This also means the cache is global. There's one type system, so there's one metadata cache. No instance management, no lifecycle, no expiration.

## Next Steps

- [Architecture](4.architecture.md) — internal design and implementation
- [API Reference](../4.reference/1.api.md) — complete type and function documentation
