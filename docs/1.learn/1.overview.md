# Overview

Sentinel extracts struct metadata at runtime, enabling type-driven generation: define your domain types once, then derive schemas, documentation, and validation logic from a single source of truth.

## The Idea

What if struct metadata was trivial to access? Go's type system already encodes field names, types, tags, and relationships—but reflection buries this behind low-level APIs.

## The Implementation

Sentinel normalizes struct metadata into a consistent, queryable format:

- **Field extraction** — names, types, kinds, and all struct tags in a uniform structure
- **Relationship discovery** — references, collections, embeddings, and maps between types
- **Recursive scanning** — traverse your entire domain model from a single entry point, respecting module boundaries
- **Permanent caching** — extract once at startup, query throughout your application

Two modes serve different needs: **Inspect** for a single type in isolation, **Scan** for all related types within your module.

## What It Enables

With consistent access to type metadata, your domain structs become the source of truth for:

- Database schemas — [dbml](https://github.com/zoobzio/dbml), [soy](https://github.com/zoobzio/soy)
- API documentation — [openapi](https://github.com/zoobzio/openapi), [rocco](https://github.com/zoobzio/rocco)
- Entity relationship diagrams — [erd](https://github.com/zoobzio/erd)
