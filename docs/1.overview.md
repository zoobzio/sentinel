# Sentinel Overview

Sentinel is a struct metadata extraction and relationship discovery library for Go with zero dependencies.

## What It Does

Sentinel extracts comprehensive metadata from Go structs at runtime:

- **Field information**: Names, types, and all struct tags
- **Type relationships**: References, collections, embeddings, and maps between types
- **Module-aware scanning**: Recursively discover related types within your module

## Why Sentinel?

Go's `reflect` package provides raw type introspection, but extracting useful metadata requires boilerplate. Sentinel handles:

- Tag parsing across all registered tags
- Relationship discovery between types
- Permanent caching (types don't change at runtime)
- Thread-safe concurrent access

## Design Philosophy

**Global state by design.** Go's type system is fixed at compile time. A struct's fields, types, and tags cannot change while the program runs. This means:

- One type system = one metadata cache
- No cache invalidation needed
- No lifecycle management required
- Safe concurrent access after initial extraction

**Package-level functions are required.** Go does not permit methods with type parameters. Functions like `Inspect[T]()` and `Scan[T]()` must be package-level—instance-based generic APIs are not possible in Go.

## Core Operations

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Inspect[T]()` | Extract metadata for a single type |
| `Scan[T]()` | Recursively extract type and all related types in module |
| `TryInspect[T]()` | Like Inspect, but returns error instead of panicking |
| `TryScan[T]()` | Like Scan, but returns error instead of panicking |
| `Tag(name)` | Register custom struct tag for extraction |
| `Browse()` | List all cached type names |
| `Lookup(name)` | Retrieve cached metadata by name |
| `Schema()` | Export all cached metadata |
| `Reset()` | Clear cache and tag registry (for testing) |
